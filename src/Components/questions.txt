1. A React component rerenders when:
    [x] It's internal state is updated
    [x] useEffect is called
    [] It's props change
    [] An event is fired from a node in its output

2. If you want to perform an action once when a component loads, you should put that code:
    [] In the body of the component function
    [] Outside the body of the compoentn function
    [x] In a call to the useEffect hook
    [] This is impossible to do in react

3. True / false: Nested components are also called child components.
    [x] True
    [] False

4. (Write answer below) - What does the import keyword do? What similar keyword do we use for javascript that is running in a NodeJS environment (using CommonJS)?

The 'import' keyword allows you to bring over code such as functions, variables, and components into another file as long as they are allowed to be exported from the file of origin. In CommonJS it is the 'require' keyword that is used.

5. Given the following code - what is the name of the component to be rendered?

    import FishTable from './components/FishTable.js';

    var fishData = [
    {
        name: 'Goldfish',
        image: 'http://tinyurl.com/n4vgcl5',
        description: 'Everyone\'s first pet'
    },
    {
        name: 'Pufferfish',
        image: 'http://tinyurl.com/kxd7cuu',
        description: 'So puffy!'
    },
    {
        name: 'Tuna',
        image: 'http://tinyurl.com/zgs7z2s',
        description: 'Why are these things so huge? THey\'re terrifying.'
    }
    ];

    ReactDOM.render(
    <FishTable fishes={fishData}/>,
    document.getElementById('app')
    );

    Put name of component here: 

FishTable

6. Given the following code:

    import FishTable from './components/FishTable.js';

var fishData = [
  {
    name: 'Goldfish',
    image: 'http://tinyurl.com/n4vgcl5',
    description: 'Everyone\'s first pet'
  },
  {
    name: 'Pufferfish',
    image: 'http://tinyurl.com/kxd7cuu',
    description: 'So puffy!'
  },
  {
    name: 'Tuna',
    image: 'http://tinyurl.com/zgs7z2s',
    description: 'Why are these things so huge? THey\'re terrifying.'
  }
];

    ReactDOM.render(
    <FishTable fishes={fishData}/>,
    document.getElementById('app')
    );

    Where is fishData being passed in and how will it be referenced? And what is the ReactJS term for how fishData will be referenced?

    Answer: 
fishData is being prop drilled down to the FishTable component and it will be referenced as 'fishes' when it is being used in the function of FishTable.

    import FishTable from './components/FishTable.js';

var fishData = [
  {
    name: 'Goldfish',
    image: 'http://tinyurl.com/n4vgcl5',
    description: 'Everyone\'s first pet'
  },
  {
    name: 'Pufferfish',

  },
  {
    name: 'Tuna',
    image: 'http://tinyurl.com/zgs7z2s',
    description: 'Why are these things so huge? THey\'re terrifying.'
  }
];

    ReactDOM.render(
    <FishTable fishes={fishData}/>,
    document.getElementById('app')
    );
